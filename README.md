# Web Scraper for SEO Marketers üë®‚Äçüíª

Beautiful Soup is the powerful library when it comes web scraping but it often struggle for the Javascript Enabled Websites. To tackle this issue, I am using the Selenium along with BeautifulSoup to parse the rendered source code of the page into python variable and then using to scrap it using BS4.


## What You Can Extract?

The Meta Tags which you can extract using this scraper are: Page Title (Length of Title), H1 (Length of H1), H2, Meta Description (Length of Meta Description), Meta Keywords, Alt Image Tags, Anchor Text & Internal Links 

Please try and let me know if you liked it..!!!!

In future, I am looking to add some features which I will share it soon!

Enjoy, also please scrap the website on your own risk..!!!!!

<b>Note:</b> Please change the path of the Chrome Driver which I have provied in my Github repository with name "chromedriver.exe".
